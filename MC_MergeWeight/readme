To get Merge sample , run 1,(2a),2b,1.  (2a) is independet of sample but dependt with FONLL & Raa.




1. MC_MergeGenSamplePtWeight.C :  merge different pt & pthat threshold sample with weight, also add pz weight (for PbPb)
	a. inputs: A merged file, 
						 A list of unmerged files (to calculate the sample merge weight)
						 File with FONLL weight , at FONLL/output folder, this weight has to be updated after recreate the merge file with weight.



2. FONLL weight : at /FONLL/ folder, 

	a. readFONLL.C : intput : FONLL distribution for prompt D0 & B (.txt files) , mt scaling to generate Prompt Ds
                         Raa assumptions 
							  output : FONLL.root , include FONLL distribution and Raa

	b. getFONLL.C : input : FONLL.root & merged root file with weight from 1.
                  output : FONLLweight








//2. MC_FONLLDataWeight.C : add FONLL & Data Weight
