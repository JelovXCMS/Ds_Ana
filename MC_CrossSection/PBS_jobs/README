run at purdue halstead note:

halstead cannot directly read file under /mnt/hadoop/
need to read via CMS proxy

1. export X509_USER_PROXY=/home/peng43/.myproxy
2. voms-proxy-init --voms cms --valid 168:00 (or myproxy with my setting), with previous X509_USER_PROXY setup , this will generate new .myproxy file

then run source ./submit_pbs.sh
